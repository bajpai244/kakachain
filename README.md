# Kakachain ðŸ¥·

Kakachain is a project made during the pragma oracle hackathon.

> It is an independent app-chain laucnhed via Madara. There is only one ERC721 token on the chain, and new mints are produced every 5 minutes by generating Kakarot<>Madara themed prompts via GPT, rendering them via Midjourney, and then minting them on Kakachain.

## Why Kakachain?

Kakachain is a way to explore the modular blockchain stack in a fun way. The idea was to see how fast can new app-chain be launched with frameworks like Madara! **and we were able to laucnh the chain with the whole project in less than 24 hours!**

Kakarot <> Madara is a fusion that everyone is waiting for, where people will be able to launch a ZK-EVM app-chain.

There are memes everywhere about it, and recently there was a lot of interest in using Midjourney to create cool images around this theme.

This is where the idea originated, how about we could run a completly automated app-chain, via Madara, where random Kakarot <> Madara themed NFTs are generated. This would be an interesting way to celebrate this fusion and at the same time a great way to explore an app-chain on Madara.

## Learnings from making Kakachain
-----

Modular blockchains will open up new world of interesting blockchain applications, I can already see so many more things I can do on this custom app-chain! for example:
- Allow only one erc721 to exits on this chain
- Put a small proof of work requirement for every NFT mint { to make sure I am not being botted }
- change the block production time to match the rate of GPT prompt generation!
- cross chain mint, allow someone to mint on Kakachain by sending a message from other chain, and much more!

I think projects like Madara, Celestia, Avail, etc are going to bring a new wave of interesting interoperable blockchain application! Let's see ðŸ¤ž
